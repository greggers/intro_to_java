# Introduction to Java

These are the code samples generated as part of [Introduction to Java](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTWbCTRBFP10nQEB6LnmgvkHBQnb7sYRH) course from [Snoozle Learning](http://learning.snoozle.net).

## How to Run

You can build each program individually from the class by going into the directory and following java build instructions. I have [a video](https://youtu.be/bBsQk1k1J7Q?t=7m30s) where I describe how you do it with both in Eclipse and in the console.

To make all at once using Mavne

Make sure you have [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) installed

Then run in the console at the top level

    mvn package
    
then go in to the target/bin/ directory and run the shell script or BAT files to run the program. 

For example, if you want to run BasicDriver in unix

    sh target/bin/BasicDriver
